# Tic Tac Toe

Base classes needed to implement tic tac toe have been provided for me. I added my logger from the previous assignment to help me test and debug. I worked on Windows.

## Implementing Negamax AI

I moved the gameOver bool to the Game's _gameOptions first, because I figured it made more sense to have it in the same place as the rest of the game variables. Then I uncommented some necessary code in Game.cpp to handle switching between the AI player and human player. I added a new function called checkForWinnerWithGameState() which works like the regular checkForWinner(), but uses any string state passed to it. This allowed me to simply generate possible game states and check them without modifying the actual board. To generate moves, I iterated through a given game state, adding the current player wherever there was a blank space. The evaluate function, from the current player's point of view, simply returns 1 if the player wins, -1 if the opponent wins, and 0 if the game is a draw. From there, I filled in negamax() and getBestMove() according to the negamax pseudocode on Wikipedia. Finally, in updateAI() I make use of the AIPlaying variable to make sure it only runs once. When I inevitably mixed up which player numbers go where, I used my logger to look at what game states were being evaluated and what values they received.
